Pokemon Challange

Description:

When a user visits the index page a random pokemon is displayed from the PokeAPI. An English description of the pokemon, along with some of it's attributes and image, is also displayed. By clicking on the pokemon's name a user is directed to API data for that pokemon. 

I used the Ruby wrapper for the API (Poke-Api-V2) as well as minitest for testing.
